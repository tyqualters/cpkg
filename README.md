# cpkg

A simple C/C++ project management tool

## Features

**Work with what you know**

Creating and managing a project, you are working with Lua. cpkg uses Ninja to then build your project.

**Work with what you don't know**

Why deal with the hassle of a CMake file? Just add a Lua script to a third party dependency and make it work.

**Automatically install dependencies**

No need for vcpkg. With the community Lua files, you can automatically download, build, and import third party dependencies with no hassle.

**Configuration**

Make it super simple to build with a specific configuration. Just run `cpkg -b -c <config>`.
